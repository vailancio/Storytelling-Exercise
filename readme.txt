I have taken a desktop-first approach.
Please have a look at the included demo videos.
I have tested on the latest version of chrome.
I could not take measurements as an open mockup file wasn't provided. So the UI doesn't look polished and precise as per PDF provided. I have tried my best to closely mimic it with visual reference. 
No jQuery plugins have been used for any interactive part.
